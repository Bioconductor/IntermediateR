# Workshop: Intermediate R Software Development

This is a series of meetings to enhance our understanding of R as a
programming language, and to connect with other people interested in R
software development. It is open to members of the Roswell Park and
SUNY at Buffalo communities. It is suitable for people who already
know R, and are eager to develop a deeper understanding of the
language and 'best practices' when tackling larger projects.

There are six sessions. Participants are expected to attend all
sessions. All sessions are 4-6 pm in the Gaylord Cary Meeting Room,
Research Studies Center, Roswell Park.

Applications CLOSED.
